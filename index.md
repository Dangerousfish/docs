# Introduction

## What is rerobots?

**rerobots** is a service for cloud-computing-like access to experimental
robotics equipment.

## How do I begin?

Currently rerobots is invite-only. If you are interested in gratis trials, then
send an email to <q@rerobots.net> or [tweet at
us](https://twitter.com/rerobots). Some of the capabilities that you can try are
demonstrated in [the tutorials](guides.html#tutorials). We would greatly value your
feedback during this early stage.
