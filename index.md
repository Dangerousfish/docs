# Introduction

## What is rerobots?

**rerobots** is a service for cloud-computing-like access to experimental
robotics equipment.

## How do I begin?

rerobots is not yet generally available. If you want early access, then send an
email to <q@rerobots.net> or [tweet at us](https://twitter.com/rerobots).

Some of the features are demonstrated in [this
video](https://vimeo.com/295230120) and [this Jupyter notebook](
