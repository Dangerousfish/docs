# Introduction

## What is rerobots?

**rerobots** is a suite of tools and services for building robots.

We maintain a variety of robots that can be remotely accessed in a *bare metal*
cloud-computing pattern.
You can develop software on these robots interactively through a Web-based IDE,
demonstrated in videos of [multi_kobuki](https://vimeo.com/465989844) and
[fixed_misty2](https://vimeo.com/488264658) workspaces.
You can also build your own applications that manage robot access with popular programming languages,
like [Python](https://pypi.org/project/rerobots/).

You can share your own robot or <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> device through the same infrastructure with
[hardshare](https://hardshare.dev/).
