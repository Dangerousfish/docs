# Introduction

## What is rerobots?

**rerobots** is a service for cloud-computing-like access to experimental
robotics equipment.

## How do I begin?

rerobots is not yet generally available. If you want early access, then [contact
us](https://rerobots.net/contact).

Some of the features are demonstrated in videos of [fixed_misty2](https://vimeo.com/440801712) and [multi_kobuki](https://vimeo.com/465989844),
and [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/rerobots/examples/blob/master/handmotion.ipynb) (try it [on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rerobots/examples/blob/master/handmotion.ipynb)).
You can also [try a sandbox](https://rerobots.net/sandbox/random).
