# Introduction

## What is rerobots?

**rerobots** is a service for cloud-computing-like access to experimental
robotics equipment.

## How do I begin?

Some of the features are demonstrated in videos of [multi_kobuki](https://vimeo.com/465989844) and [fixed_misty2](https://vimeo.com/440801712).
You can also [try a sandbox](https://rerobots.net/sandbox).
If you have hardware that you want to share on a distributed team or with a
class that you are teaching, then try [hardshare](https://hardshare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

rerobots is not yet generally available. If you want early access, then [contact
us](https://rerobots.net/contact) or [join the community on
Discord](https://discord.gg/ur3jTyw).
