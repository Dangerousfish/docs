## Founding Robotics Startups with a PhD

### Summary

This [RSS 2021 workshop](https://roboticsconference.org/) will teach you about starting your own company if you recently earned (or will soon earn) your PhD.
While there is a lot of prior writing about startups in general, there is not a lot about robotics companies, and even less about doing so shortly after grad school.
For something as idiosyncratic as founding a company to realize your dreams, the best lessons come from those who have gone before you.
